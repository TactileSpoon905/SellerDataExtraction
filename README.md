# SellerDataExtraction
The following is a data analysis task as part of a volunteering activity at Amazon. A special thanks to the Catalogue Specialist team for providing the opportunity to showcase this work on GitHub
- *_Update (Dec 2021)_* : The Python code was compressed and simplified using a smarter regex and function approach (version 2.0). Additionally, merchant IDs (tokens that range from 10-15 characters) are now included in searching pattern
## Objective
Use python script (in Jupyter Lab IDE) to extract specific text from a collection of computer logs stored in an excel file. We use Pandas DataFrame and string pattern matching to accomplish this task
